# Simon Game üéØ

This is a web-based **Simon Game**, inspired by the classic memory game. This was a practice project designed to help me improve my understanding of the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, event handling, and JavaScript fundamentals.

## About the Project

- A fun memory-based game where the player has to remember and repeat the sequence of colors.
- Each round adds a new color to the sequence.
- The game ends if the player clicks the wrong color.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Key Learnings

- DOM manipulation
- Handling user events (clicks, keypress)
- Working with arrays and sequences in JavaScript
- Improving logic building and problem-solving in JS

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will flash a sequence of colors ‚Äî remember them!
3. Click the colors in the same order as they appeared.
4. Each correct attempt increases the level by adding one more color to the sequence.
5. A wrong click ends the game and shows the current level.
